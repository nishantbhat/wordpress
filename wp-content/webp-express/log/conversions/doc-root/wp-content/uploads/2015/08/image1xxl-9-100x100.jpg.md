Options:
------------
The following options have been set explicitly. Note: it is the resulting options after merging down the "jpeg" and "png" options and any converter-prefixed options.

- log-call-arguments: true
- converters: (array of 9 items)

The following options have not been explicitly set, so using the following defaults:
- converter-options: (empty array)
- shuffle: false
- preferred-converters: (empty array)
- extra-converters: (empty array)

The following options were supplied and are passed on to the converters in the stack:
- default-quality: 70
- encoding: "auto"
- max-quality: 80
- metadata: "none"
- near-lossless: 60

Converting to lossy
Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version. Result: *Exec failed* (the cwebp binary was not found at path: cwebp)
Nope a plain cwebp call does not work
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 0 binaries
Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)
Found 1 binaries: 
- /usr/local/bin/cwebp
Discovering binaries which are distributed with the webp-convert library (to skip this step, disable the "try-supplied-binary-for-os" option)
Checking if we have a supplied precompiled binary for your OS (Darwin)... We do.

- /usr/local/bin/cwebp: (version: 1.0.3)
Trying the first of these. If that should fail (it should not), the next will be tried and so on.

Quality of source is 90. This is higher than max-quality, so using max-quality instead (80)
The near-lossless option ignored for lossy
