Converting to lossy
Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version. Result: *Exec failed* (the cwebp binary was not found at path: cwebp)
Nope a plain cwebp call does not work
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 0 binaries
Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)
Found 1 binaries: 
- /usr/local/bin/cwebp
Discovering binaries which are distributed with the webp-convert library (to skip this step, disable the "try-supplied-binary-for-os" option)
Checking if we have a supplied precompiled binary for your OS (Darwin)... We do.

Trying the first of these. If that should fail (it should not), the next will be tried and so on.

Quality of source is 90. This is higher than max-quality, so using max-quality instead (80)
The near-lossless option ignored for lossy
