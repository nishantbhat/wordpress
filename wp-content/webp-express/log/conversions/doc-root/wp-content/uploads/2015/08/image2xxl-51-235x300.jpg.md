Converting to lossy
Locating cwebp binaries

Checking if we have a supplied binary for OS: Darwin... We do.
We in fact have 1
A total of 2 cwebp binaries where found
Detecting versions of the cwebp binaries found (and verifying that they can be executed in the process)

Quality of source is 82. This is higher than max-quality, so using max-quality instead (80)
The near-lossless option ignored for lossy
