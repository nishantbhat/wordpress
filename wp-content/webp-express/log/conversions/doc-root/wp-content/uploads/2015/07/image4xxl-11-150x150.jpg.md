Converting to lossy
Locating cwebp binaries
1 cwebp binaries found in common system locations
Checking if we have a supplied binary for OS: Darwin... We do.
We in fact have 1
A total of 2 cwebp binaries where found
Detecting versions of the cwebp binaries found (and verifying that they can be executed in the process)
Executing: /usr/local/bin/cwebp -version. Result: version: 1.0.3

Quality of source is 82. This is higher than max-quality, so using max-quality instead (80)
The near-lossless option ignored for lossy
